# Balanced Instance Sampling for SARL Enhanced GELU

## Overview

This implementation adds **Balanced Instance Sampling** to the SARL Enhanced GELU model, addressing the potential bias that can occur when semantically similar classes are over-sampled during buffer replay. This optimization ensures balanced sampling across semantic groups, leading to more robust continual learning performance.

## Key Innovation

### Problem Addressed
- **Original Issue**: Uniform sampling from the buffer can lead to bias when semantically similar classes are over-represented
- **Impact**: Overfitting on intra-group similarities, reduced diversity in contrastive learning
- **Solution**: Balanced instance sampling that prioritizes underrepresented semantic groups

### Core Concept
The balanced sampling mechanism computes importance scores for each buffer sample based on:
1. **Semantic Similarity**: How similar a sample is to its class prototype
2. **Group Balance**: The relative representation of the sample's semantic group

**Importance Formula**:
```
importance[i] = (1 / (semantic_similarity(feats[i], op[labels[i]]) + ε)) × balance_factor
```
where `balance_factor = total_groups / group_size_of_sample`

## Architecture Components

### 1. BalancedBuffer Class
```python
class BalancedBuffer(Buffer):
    def __init__(self, buffer_size, device, semantic_similarity, adaptive_threshold, num_feats):
        # Enhanced buffer with semantic group tracking
        self.semantic_groups = {}  # Track semantic group assignments
        self.group_counts = {}     # Track group sizes
        self.sample_features = {}  # Store features for semantic computation
```

**Key Features**:
- **Semantic Group Tracking**: Automatically assigns samples to semantic groups
- **Feature Storage**: Maintains features for importance computation
- **Balanced Sampling**: Uses importance-weighted sampling instead of uniform sampling

### 2. Semantic Group Assignment
```python
# Assign semantic group based on learned similarity
sim_score = self.semantic_similarity(features[i], prototype).item()
group_id = self.adaptive_threshold(torch.tensor([sim_score])).item()
```

**Process**:
1. Compute similarity between sample features and class prototype
2. Use adaptive threshold to determine semantic group membership
3. Track group distribution for balance calculation

### 3. Importance Score Computation
```python
def get_balanced_data(self, minibatch_size, transform=None, op_prototypes=None):
    # Compute semantic group balance scores
    total_groups = len(self.group_counts)
    balance_factors = {}
    
    for group_id, count in self.group_counts.items():
        balance_factors[group_id] = total_groups / count
    
    # Calculate importance scores
    importance = (1.0 / (sim_score + self.epsilon)) * balance_factor
```

**Benefits**:
- **Underrepresented Groups**: Get higher importance scores
- **Hard Negatives**: Samples from distant semantic groups are prioritized
- **Diversity**: Ensures balanced representation in each batch

## Implementation Details

### Integration with SARL Enhanced GELU

The balanced sampling is seamlessly integrated into the existing SARL framework:

```python
class SARLEnhancedGeluBalanced(ContinualModel):
    def __init__(self, backbone, loss, args, transform):
        # Initialize semantic components first
        self.semantic_similarity = SemanticSimilarity(args.num_feats).to(self.device)
        self.adaptive_threshold = AdaptiveThreshold().to(self.device)
        
        # Initialize balanced buffer
        if args.use_balanced_sampling:
            self.buffer = BalancedBuffer(
                self.args.buffer_size, 
                self.device, 
                self.semantic_similarity, 
                self.adaptive_threshold, 
                args.num_feats
            )
```

### Training Process

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features during forward pass
2. **Buffer Addition**: Store samples with features for semantic computation
3. **Balanced Sampling**: Use importance-weighted sampling for replay
4. **Semantic Learning**: Update semantic similarity network with balanced batches

```python
def observe(self, inputs, labels, not_aug_inputs):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Use balanced sampling if enabled
    if self.args.use_balanced_sampling and isinstance(self.buffer, BalancedBuffer):
        buf_inputs, buf_labels, buf_logits = self.buffer.get_balanced_data(
            self.args.minibatch_size, 
            transform=self.transform,
            op_prototypes=self.op if self.current_task > 0 else None
        )
    
    # Add data to buffer with features for balanced sampling
    if self.args.use_balanced_sampling and isinstance(self.buffer, BalancedBuffer):
        self.buffer.add_data(
            examples=not_aug_inputs,
            labels=labels[:real_batch_size],
            logits=outputs.data,
            features=activations['feat'][:real_batch_size]
        )
```
